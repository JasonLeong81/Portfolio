        <p>My name is Jason and I am 23 years of age. I have a bachelors degree in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence from Tilburg University and I am now working as a credit risk data scientist for
            Novum Bank. I am also pursuing an online part-time master program in applied statistics at the University of Strathclyde.

                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <p>I have experience in Python, R, C#, and T-SQL. In my free time, I like to go on LeetCode and CodeForces to practise algorithmic questions as they help improve my critical thinking skills. Although nowadays I spent more time with SQL (almost 70% of my job), from building analytical
                    tables to optimizing queries and investigating query plans, I have become a master in finding culprits that are slowing everything down :) The most interesting thing about programming is that a lot of the time having an easy to maintain codebase is always better than an overly optimized one (that is hard to read and too complex to change things).
                    Generally I like to brainstorm a lot before implementing a feature, thinking how this would affect other technical details or even if it would affect the final business interpretation of the output (if affected). As with any company with an IT department (they are always on our backs about storage!), I tend to be careful whenever I initiate something that involves loads of writes to disks.
                    Code reviews are also an important exercise, especially for the team to get to know what everyone is working on and yourself in case an edge case is missed. I'd follow the four eye principle even for minor changes because we can never trust our unit tests 100%! Finally, what's programming without coffee! I take mine with snacks like cookies in the morning, how about you?

                <h1>Data Science and Machine Learning</h1>
                <p>As a credit risk data scientist, I devise strategies to create an impact for my company such that KPIs are met without unnecessary costs. Devising a strategy takes time and loads of efforts as we'd have to understand the data
                and determine what we want to do with it. Many times I like to work bidirectionally, that is, from technical details to business metrics as well as from business metrics back to technical details. It may seem important to always start from the business point of view
                and work backwards, but for me, I like to take into account the overheads of technical implementations. If a devised strategy is making it too complicated to technically implement, and only small marginal gains will be a result of it, then I'd generally opt for another strategy
                or find a better metric given the current situation and time. As a data scientist, I think it is crucial to have good intuition (then search for data evidence later) not just about what kinds of metrics we should use but more importantly the feasibility of using it at any given situation and time. If building a model
                doesn't give us a significant forecasted improvement in our KPIs, then don't release it. Similarly, if using simple hard rules can already help us achieve 80% of the target, we should prioritise maintaining those rules but also be sure to check on their validity from time to time.</p>

                <h1>Expression Recognition using Supervised ML algorithms</h1>
                <p>This is a project in which the dataset contains multiple class label such as happy, sad, anxious, confused, and so on. There are also different variants of sadness such as very sad or just a little sad. The goal is to correctly predict what expression is presented in images. The input data was huge therefore I applied dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis. I trained several classification. For classification, I tried linear SVM, kernel SVM, and decision trees with entropy as purity measurement.</p>
